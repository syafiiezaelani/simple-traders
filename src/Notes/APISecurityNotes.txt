Hide API keys before pushing to GIT. 

Start with .env file, short for environtment file. 
you just create key value pairs to be able to access those keys. 

You shouldnt use any of the secret env code for front end when you host the project in real life, you can create a backend api end point to get around this. 

there is another issue, anyone else also has access to the endpoint that you have created, so again it defeats the purpose. a way to get around this is to send the request together with a password that you know, cause on the server side you know what to expect for this password. 

CORS. basically you can define rules that the browser to respect. so for example you can say only these domain can use this endpoint. 

finally you can use secret credential or token where the api can validate the request. 

can also use json webtoken. when the user logs in, they are given that token. then can use that to validate.
